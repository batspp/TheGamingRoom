# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room client was investigating options for making their game, "Draw It or Lose It," work on multiple operating platforms through a browser. The prototype I created required some server/client development as well as educating the client on the pros and cons of each platform option for the game application. These were detailed in the software design document provided in this repository.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I believe I was able to explain each platform option, and recommendation, in a clear way that is easily understood by a technical and non-technical audience.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The process itself helped organize my thoughts on how to go about designing software, including where to begin. Without a clear path or plan, software development can fall very deep into a rabbit hole and become disorganised with more hours spend figuring out a solution to a problem rather than writting code. Being planned before beginning development elliminated unforseen hurdles in the development process, since they can be address before any single character of code is typed.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the table of operating platforms. Although great amount of research was done to complete the table and make a well educated recommendation to the client, there is still so much more to each platform that wasn't addressed. Such as Windows being able to utilize a Linux virtual machine environement.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  Listening to the non-technical expectation of the software is an outstanding start to finding basic requirements. Once the requirements were clear, I was able to investigate the options availible for the client and explain why I would want to develop (or not develop) their ideas on a certain operating platform or environment. For example, if their application functions had many requests to cloud service it would cost more since the price is determined by use, and requests for that service from the vendor.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Working one step at a time, and distributing the tasks into a form of "sprints" helped progress the design document smoothly and efficiently. Similarly, I would do the same if analyzing the design of a similar software application.
